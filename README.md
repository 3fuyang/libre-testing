# Libre Testing v2

This is a rewrite of the original Libre Testing project using modern React technologies, aiming for better illustration of how a modern static SPA looks like for learning purposes.

## TODOs

- [ ] Spawn workers for each running test so the UI keeps always responsive
- [ ] Breadcrumb
- [ ] Encapsulate panel components to be easily composed but keep them flexible
- [ ] Site performance improvements - Best balance between FP and first impression
- [ ] Subdomain deployment
