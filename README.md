# Libre Testing v2

This is a rewrite of the original Libre Testing project using modern React technologies, aiming for better illustration of how a modern static SPA looks like for learning purposes.

## Stack

- Framework: [React 19](https://react.dev/) with [Tanstack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest)
- State Management: [Jotai](https://jotai.org/)
- UI: [Shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Misc: React Compiler

## TODOs

- [x] Spawn workers for each running test so the UI keeps always responsive
- [x] Breadcrumb
- [ ] Encapsulate panel components to be easily composed but keep them flexible
- [ ] Site performance improvements - Best balance between FP and first impression
- [x] Subdomain deployment
